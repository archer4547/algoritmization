If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:

I would characterize audio aura using:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:

multiply numbers by their importancy level, for example:
energy_average * 3, valence * 2, danceability * 1
