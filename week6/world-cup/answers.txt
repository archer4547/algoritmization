Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

predictions with low amount of simulations were incorrect

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10000 simulations is good enough
